### Motivation
[TheDAO hack](http://www.coindesk.com/understanding-dao-hack-journalists/) raised concerns in the Ethereum community about existing security measures to audit contracts, especially those that are expected to hold substantial amounts of money, as in the case of crowdfunding/ICO sales.

Different tools have been proposed to increase users' confidence in the security of high stake contracts, such as Formal Verification and Manual Bug Bounties.

We present a mechanism that allows high-stake contract authors to create a trustless, ethereum-based Bug Bounty to be used in the period after the high-stake contract is published and **before** it is put in production.

Such a mechanism is expected to draw attention from challengers with the necessary technical skills to find vulnerabilities, as they can ascertain with high confidence how and what kind of reward they might get. This will also help instill confidence in potential investors, knowing that the contract author has staked their own funds to vouch for the correctness of the contract.

Following a [tweet](https://twitter.com/random_walker/status/692807445408845824) by @random_walker, de la Rouviere [mentioned](https://media.consensys.net/2016/05/05/assert-guards-towards-automated-code-bounties-safe-smart-contract-coding-on-ethereum/) automatic bounties back in May 2016.

Peter Borah [gave](https://medium.com/@peterborah/we-need-fault-tolerant-smart-contracts-ec1b56596dbc#.1j7it3cff) an example of how an automated bug bounty for a specific contract could be created.

Manuel Ar√°oz [showed another example](https://medium.com/zeppelin-blog/onward-with-ethereum-smart-contract-security-97a827e47702#.o4ckev1rf) of a contract-specific automated bug bounty as one tool in contract security.

Our contribution is to propose a general-purpose, reusable "Put Your Money Where Your Contract Is" Bounty manager contract that allows high stake contract creators to set up bounty programs with minimal overhead, and provides higher confidence for challengers that they will receive the award if they are successful.

### Detailed Description (why it works this way)
An automated bug bounty, just like any decentralized app, should create economic incentive for all sides to play fairly. We examine what might go wrong for each participant.

#### What Alice (the Author) has to be concerned about
 1. She finds a bug in the code before someone else notices.
2. Challenger retrieves bounty sum without finding a fault with the contract.
3. Challenger finds a vulnerability in the code but decides not to tell anyone about it and exploit it later on.

#### What Charlie (the Bounty Challenger) has to be concerned about
3. He finds a vulnerability in the code 
4. Someone finds his attack plan and gets the bounty.
2. Alice 


First iteration - let Alice 


#### Contracts Involved
* `BountyManager`  is the contract registry for bounties. It registers and manages bounties. Its code is presened [here](https://github.com/rmerom/PutYourMoneyWhereYourContractIs/blob/master/contracts/BountyManager.sol).
* `TargetContract` is the high stake contract that the Author challenges other to find vulnerabilities in. It has to adhere to some guidelines (see <a href='#constraints-for-targetcontract'>Constraints</a>).
* `BountyContract` is written by the Author in a collobarative manner with the community to try and identify any potential invalid states of the contract. Examples might include the contract not having the amount of money it "thinks" it has, or a changing number of total tokens in case of a token contract. `BountyContract` also has a method for generating &amp; deploying a brand new `TargetContract` for challenging.
* `ContractEnvironmentInterface` is an abstract contract providing access to environment variables (e.g. `block.number`) for `TargetContract` to help the challenger set up a scenario where the contract fails. `ContractTestEnvironment` is a concrete descendant that allows a challenger to play with the environment under some reasonable restrictions. While a `ContractTestEnvironment` is presented in this work, the Author may choose to copy and modify it in a way she sees as reasonable for her contract.
* Any number of so-called "attack contracts" by the Bounty Challenger that help her expose the vulnerability in `TargetContract`.


#### Order of interactions
1. Alice publishes `TargetContract` and a draft of `BountyContract`. Both, and especially the latter, are up for community inspection for some period of time. Potential challengers, as well as security experts, may suggest additional tests to add to `BountyContract`, either formally (see <a href="#future-directions">Future Directions</a>) or informally (through forums etc.).
2. Once that period is over, Alice deploys the final version of `BountyContract` and registers it with the `BountyManager` contract, along with the bounty deposit. She also defines a period *p* during which the bounty is open for grabs for anyone who manages to coerce the contract into an invalid state.
3. Charlie the Challenger believes he can break `TargetContract` in a way that `BountyContract.assertInvalidState()` will return true. He quietly builds up and verifies his strategy offline. When he's ready, he creates in advance the transactions needed to prove `TargetContract`'s vulnerability. He pre-deploys any required attack contracts discretely on the Ethereum production blockchain. He may also play (in any legitimate way) with `TargetContract`'s environment by pre-creating his own instance of `EnvironmentContractInterface`.
4.  Charlie calls `BountyManager.initiateChallenge()` with a deposit of 5% of the bounty sum. This makes sure `BountyManager` locks the `BountyContract` bounty solely for Charlie for the next 40 blocks (~10 minutes). 
5.  Charlie calls `BountyManager.challengeContract()` with the address of his attack contract (and likely with a lot of gas).
6. `BountyManager` calls Charlie's `ChallengerContract`, and Charlie may inititate any additional transactions with pre-prepared attack contracts in order to `TargetContract` into an invalid state. He then calls `BountyManager.assertState()`.
7. If successful, the bounty fund in `BountyManager` becomes withdrawable by Charlie. Otherwise, [TBD what happens with Charlie's deposit. Should not be given to Alice to prevent her from DoSing the bounty].

### Constraints applicable to `TargetContract`
Constraints below apply both to `TargetContract` and to any external methods it calls (in libraries and/or external contracts).
* In order to allow assertions about what the contract owner should do, its contrsuctor should not use `msg.sender`. If needed, the owner should instead be dependency-injected as a parameter (and be populated with the challenger's address upon creation of a challenge).
* It should not use any of the environment variables, but instead use the `EnvironmentContractInterface` passed in its constructor to retrieve those. In production, it would use [EnvironmentProd](https://github.com/rmerom/PutYourMoneyWhereYourContractIs/blob/master/contracts/EnvironmentProd.sol) which simply returns the actual variable values. To enhance performance, in future an open source tool would be able to replace any such calls with the direct environment variables to reduce gas costs.


### Security Aspects

TODO(rmerom): complete this section.

### Future Directions
1. Devlelop methodologies for testing a system composed of multiple contracts.
2. Allow Challengers to formally suggest new tests for `TargetContract`. The requirement for formal, open suggestion is that even the suggestion might expose vulnerability information to the Author. By formally and openly suggesting new tests, the Author reputation is at stake if she rejects them based on the fact that she realizes they expose a vulnerability.
3. Allow different tests to be associated with different bounty values s.t. more major vulnerabilites will produce higher bounty prizes.
4. Allow a temporal increase of bounty prize (for example, bounty starts at `b/10` and climbs up to `b` Ether). This will allow obvious bugs that were overlooked to be fixed without Alice having to pay the entire bounty amount.
