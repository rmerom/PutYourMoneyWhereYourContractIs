 * An example base class for contract that is going to be bug-bountied.
 * You do not need to use this class for PYMWYCI to work.
 * 
 * NOTE however: it is important that the contract does not use the following 
 * directly:
 * block.blockhash, block.coinbase, block.difficulty, block.gaslimit, block.number
 * block.timestamp and now. 
 * Instead it should use the injected _env variable.
 * 
 * It is also advisable for a bountable contract to publicily expose as much of the
 * state variables as is feasible, because that will let its respective ContractTest 
 * verify its validity.
